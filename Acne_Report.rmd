# Project Summary
The goal of this study is to characterize the use of oral antibiotics for the treatment of acne in patients aged 10-45. We conducted a retrospective, observational, cohort study using the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) database and data from Health Data Compass at the University of Colorado.

Eligibility of patients included is displayed below.

# Methods

Continuous variables are summarized by mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum whereas categorical variables are presented as the number in each group and percent of column total. Comparisons between groups were conducted using Chi square tests for categorical variables (sex, race, ethnicity) and t-tests for continuous variables (age). All tests were evaluated at the 0.05 significance level. Due to the large size of this cohort, very small differences will reach statistical significance even when the differences are not clinically relevant. Thus we will only report clinically meaningful differences. R version 3.6.0 was used for all summaries and figures.

# Results

Table 1.1 compares patients with and without an antibiotic treatment course of interest and Table 1.2 compares patients with and without an isotretinoin prescription. Overall, the patient population is overwhelmingingly female composed of mostly non-hispanic white individuals with a median age of 20 (Table 1.1, Table 1.2).

Although we observed a statistically significant difference in age, sex, and race between patients who received at least one course of antibiotics and those who did not, the magnitude of the differences in age and race were very small and not clincially meaningful (Table 1.1). In contrast to age and race, receipt of antibiotics was meaningfully different by sex. Despite an overwhelmingly female population (70.6% female), only 63.2% of patients recieving antibiotics were female. Among the 4,605 male patients in the eligible cohort, 1,810 (39%) of them received an antibioitic treatment of interest in comparison to 3,109 (28%) of the 11,093 eligible women. This supports the hypothesis that while more female patients seek treatment for acne, they are prescribed less often than male patients as male patients are hypothesized to only seek treatment following a more severe acne diagnosis.

There was a similar trend for patients using isotretinoin. Differences in age, sex, and race were all statistically significant but only sex had a clinically meaningful difference between patients with and without an isotretinoin treatment (Table 1.2). Among the 4,605 eligible men in this population, 988 (21.5%) of them received an isotretinoin course of treatment compared to only 1,159 of 11,093 eligible women (10.4%).

We assessed whether the proportion of patients who received medication was different based on sex using an unadjusted logistic regression model with the binary outcome of receiving medication or not (Table 2). Our results suggest that male patients are 1.67 times as likely to have received an antibiotic prescription (95% CI=1.55,1.79) and over twice as likely (OR=2.34, CI=2.13,2.57) to have received an isotretinoin prescription than female patients.

Among those who recieved at least one course of antibiotic treatment, the mean amount of time between first acne diagnosis and drug exposure start date was less than one day.

A diagnosis of "Acne" was by far the most common diagnosis in the eligible population (Figure 1)

Minocycline was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic of interest followed by doxycycline (Figure 2). When exploring antibiotic prescriptions over time, minocycline was the most prevelent initial antibiotic in every year of data captured in this analysis, although we see a steady decline in prescriptions beginning in the year 2013. In that year, prescriptions for doxycycline, the second most prevelent antibiotic, begin to increase (Figure 3). There were notably fewer prescriptions in the years leading up to 2015 with less than 1,000 initial antibiotic prescriptions in each year between 2011 and 2014. Each year after 2015, had roughly 1,500 initial antibiotic prescriptions per year as seen in Figure 4. The number of prescriptions can be found in Figures 5 and 6, where Figure 6 combines all other antibiotics besides doxycycline and minocycline. Most individuals who visited the doctor were not prescribed any medication (69%). About one quarter (23%) of eligible individuals had one visit that resulted in an antibiotic medication being prescribed (Figure 7).When allowing for multiple prescriptions per person, doxycycline was the most prevelent antibiotic in 2011 before minocycline became much more prevelent in 2013. However, after 2013 the proportion of minocycline prescriptions steadily declined after that point whereas the proporiton of doxycycline prescriptions steadily increased over time (Figure 8).  

Most individuals did not receive isotretinoin (Figure 9). Over time, first-time isotretinoin prescriptions steadily increased until the year 2015 when a maximum of 3,000  prescriptions occured, followed by a general decreasing trend until 2019 (Figure 10). When allowing for multiple prescriptions per person, isotretinoin prescriptions had a steady increase over time (Figure 11).

# Limitations 

Some individuals had one or more eligible visits that had no matching visit concept ID. For these individuals, we cannot determine whether the visit type was an inpatient visit, outpatient visit, or otherwise. A senstivity analysis was done and results were consistent with or without these individuals inlcuded in the analysis. 

Other data limitations include missing information on insurance at the time of treatment, severity of disease, treatment length, prescription refills, and quantity of treatment prescribed. Future data collection should aim to capture these elements. Additionally, all graphs depicting multiple prescriptions per person were taken from multiple occurences in the dataset and potentially exclude refills.

# Appendix 

There are 7 affiliated csv files; 6 for antibiotics of interest and 1 for isotretinoin. Eligible prescription drug concept IDs are listed in the "Id" column. Minimum length for all drug courses was a quantity of 27 unless otherwise listed in the "Standards" csv file.
